title: "Sum of averages vs average of sums"
---

Say you have a time-series of data coming from multiple sources \[[^1]\], and you want to aggregate the data together to have a running average over the last \(n\) time periods.
For this, you could use (among other techniques) a [simple moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average_(boxcar_filter)), or an [exponential moving average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average).

We won't go into the details here, though they are fairly interesting on their own.
What I was curious about for this task is that we have two dimensions of data (each source has a value for each timestamp), but one dimension of output.
So, do you:

1. take the moving average of each source, and sum the averages? Or,
1. take the moving average of the sum of the data for each timestamp?

It's not immediately obvious to me that they'll each produce the same metric.
In the particular system I'm working in, each method would lead to vastly different implementations, so it's important to make sure it still measures what we think it does.

### Example: disk throughput

To give a concrete example, we have 3 disks on a server, each reporting its throughput in the last second.

|               | 02:52:19 | 02:52:20 | 02:52:21 | 02:52:22 | 02:52:23 |
|---------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Disk 1 (MB/s) | 478      | 344      | 461      | 475      | 96       |
| Disk 2 (MB/s) | 193      | 267      | 224      | 51       | 456      |
| Disk 3 (MB/s) | 55       | 386      | 314      | 221      | 17       |

We want to find the average trailing 5s throughput on the server.
In method 1, we track the 5s average for each disk, and sum them:

|        | 5s avg TP (MB/s), SMA | 5s avg TP (MB/s), EMA |
|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Disk 1 | 370.80 | |
| Disk 2 |  | |
| Disk 3 | | |

[^1]: This could be, say, throughput on each disk hosted on a server. But I'm not picky.
