In mid-September 2020, I did a guided climb of Mount Rainier via the Disapointment Cleaver route.

## Training

My training consisted of some typical tougher hikes, carrying a weighted pack (with ~25 lbs extra weight, mostly from water and extra Rainiers):

* Mt. Si
* Mailbox Peak -- up old trail, down new trail
* Mt. Washington
* Alta Mtn.
* Navaho Peak

{% include gallery-img.html img="beer-3.jpg" caption="Mt. Si" %}
</div>

A single, much longer hike through the Enchantments I did without extra weight:

## Night 2/Day 3: Summit

The summit climb started at midnight, and reached the summit around sunrise, so no pictures from the climb itself.
