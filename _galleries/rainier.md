## Training

Rainier is a tough physical endeavor.
I prepared, both physically and mentally, for a tough climb but it still exceeded my expectations for difficulty.

Roughly my training consisted of:

* Mt. Si
* Mailbox Peak -- up old trail, down new trail
* Mt. Washington
* Alta Mtn.
* Enchantments 1-day thru-hike
  * This was a mistake.
  Both Michael and I fucked up our knees doing this.
* Navaho Peak
* Lots of regular running & weight exercises

For each of the above, I used a weighted pack, filled with approx. 25 lbs in water and whatever other heavy gear I could find.
Usually that included Rainiers!

## Packing

We packed twice on the trip: once at home, squeezing all our gear into the bag.
And again at IMG headquarters, where you meet the guides and they inspect your gear and tell you what you should and shouldn't bring.

What I brought out there, but was told not to bring on the climb:

* Thermal sleeping bag liner: my bag is rated for 20 F, which they said was enough without the liner.
I was plenty warm at night, so I don't regret not bringing the liner.
* Heavy insulated mittens: left behind, in favor of just bringing mid-weight gloves. 
My hands were only cold near the top when we were stopped.
While we were climbing, the mittens would have been too hot and clumsy.
In hindsight, it would have been especially difficult to clip and unclip from the ropes or even hold the ice axe with mittens on.
* Lighter hiking pants: the guides tailored their gear recommendations based on the forecasted weather conditions.
In our case they recommended only bringing the heavier soft-shell climbing pants if we had them.

In general, the idea with clothing is to pack as little as possible.
I only ended up bringing two shirts, socks, and underwear, including the ones I was wearing.
