Here I catalogue my preparations and experience climbing Mt. Rainier.

## Training

Roughly my training consisted of:

* Mt. Si
* Mailbox Peak -- up old trail, down new trail
* Mt. Washington
* Alta Mtn.
* Enchantments 1-day thru-hike
  * This one was a mistake; both Michael and I fucked up our knees doing this.
* Navaho Peak
* Regular running & free weight exercises

For each of the above, except for the Enchantments, I used a weighted pack filled with approx. 25 lbs in water and whatever other heavy gear I could find.
Usually that included Rainiers!

On the topic of the Enchantments hike, both myself and Michael (a friend also on our climb) ended up with some extraordinary knee pain after.
Michael had prior issues with one of his knees, and essentially re-opened a preexisting injury, but I had not and it was new.
I ended up seeing a sports medicine doctor who diagnosed it as strain caused by weakness in hip muscles which stabilize the knee joint on downhill impacts, and perscribed physical therapy, though I didn't end up seeing the PT until after the climb.
Overall, it was just a bad choice for Rainier, since there was a period I was not sure my knee would recover in time.

## Packing

We packed twice on the trip: once at home, squeezing all our gear into the bag.
And again at IMG headquarters, where you meet the guides and they inspect your gear and tell you what you should and shouldn't bring.

What I brought out there, but was told not to bring on the climb:

* Thermal sleeping bag liner: my bag is rated for 20 F, which they said was enough without the liner.
I was plenty warm at night, so I don't regret not bringing the liner.
* Heavy insulated mittens: left behind, in favor of just bringing mid-weight gloves. 
My hands were only cold near the top when we were stopped.
While we were climbing, the mittens would have been too hot and clumsy.
In hindsight, it would have been especially difficult to clip and unclip from the ropes or even hold the ice axe with mittens on.
* Lighter hiking pants: the guides tailored their gear recommendations based on the forecasted weather conditions.
In our case they recommended only bringing the heavier soft-shell climbing pants if we had them.

In general, the idea with clothing is to pack as little as possible.
I only ended up bringing two shirts, socks, and underwear, including the ones I was wearing.
