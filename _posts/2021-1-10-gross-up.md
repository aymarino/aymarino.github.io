title: Calculating taxable expense gross-ups
---

When a company reimburses an employee for out-of-pocket expenses, it'll typically also add in a "gross-up" for income tax, since the reimbursement is reported as W2 income. Otherwise, the employee would have not been fully reimbursed. How do you arrive at what the correct gross-up is, since obviously the gross-up amount itself is also subject to the same taxes.

I had the idea to hit it with some middle-school algebra:

$$ u = (r + u) \times t $$

where \\(u\\) is the gross-up amount, \\(r\\) is the original reimbursement and \\(t\\) is the tax rate. Solve for \\(u\\):

$$ \begin{aligned}
    u - ut &= rt \\
    u(1 - t) &= rt \\
    u &= \frac{rt}{1 - t}
\end{aligned} $$

What's interesting is the right side can be arrived at in procedural terms by looking that the problem as: what amount would result in the taxes on the original reimbursement (\\(rt\\)), when you took out the taxes owed on it (\\(u (1 - t)\\))? Or even more clearly if we think in terms of \\(u + r\\), i.e. the total amount paid by the company to cover the reimbursement.

$$ \begin{aligned}
    u + r &= \frac{rt + r(1 - t)}{1 - t} \\
    u + r &= \frac{r}{1 - t}
\end{aligned} $$

In other words, to figure \\(r + u\\), ask what amount would result in \\(r\\) after taxes:

$$ (u + r)(1 - t) = r $$

The latter is a much easier way of thinking about the problem.
